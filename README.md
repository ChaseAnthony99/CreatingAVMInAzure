The above picture is showing right after you click create virtual machine in Azure. The picture outlines a few different ways you can alter the Virtual Machine you are creating such as the region you would like your Virtual Machine to be in, basic networking, and more.

<p>
The above picture is after the deployment process has been completed. Now you are shown basic information about the virtual machine you have created such as the IP address, settings, and even a tutorial to assist you with any questions you may have about the virtual machine. From this point, you can go deeper and use more advanced settings, and perform relevant work based on the reason you created the virtual machine.
